# examples/easy/ec2

In this example we'll instantiate a simple nginx webserver.

Task networking mode in this example is `host` so that the port specified in `templates/container_definitions.tpl` will be bind.
Means there cannot be more than 1 task in an instance. Do experiment with dynamic port mapping with `bridge` network mode.

This example will also create `vpc` and `security_group` and `autoscaling group`.

Note: Instance profile is required for EC2 to connect to ECS Cluster. See [`modules/iam/ecs-instance-profile`](https://github.com/HENNGE/terraform-aws-ecs/tree/main/modules/iam/ecs-instance-profile).

To test that it's working:
1. Go to EC2 console
1. Find the EC2 instance started by this example. (Search the name)
1. Go to the IP Address, you should see nginx hello world screen

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
