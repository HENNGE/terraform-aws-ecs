# core/service

A Terraform module to define AWS ECS Service

Create ECS Service that can be connected to ELB/ALB

Offers creation of `task_definition` as well. By default, this will create corresponding `task_definition` for the service.

The goal of this module is to present a unified view between `ECS Service` and `ECS Task Definition` so only by defining `module "ecs"` and supplying `container_definitions` json, an ECS service would be up and running.

Since this module is the closest to the `resources` form, there are a lot of customization, for those who want it easy, do check the `simple` module instead of this `core` module.

| enable\_deployment\_circuit\_breaker\_with\_rollback | Enable Deployment Circuit Breaker with Rollback. When a service deployment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment that completed successfully. | `bool` | `false` | no |

| enable\_ecs\_managed\_tags | Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service. Boolean value. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| enable\_execute\_command | Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS Exec for the tasks within the service. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| force\_new\_deployment | Enable to force a new task deployment of the service. This can be used to update tasks to use a newer Docker image with same image/tag combination (e.g. `myimage:latest`), roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version, or immediately deploy `ordered_placement_strategy` and `placement_constraints` updates. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| health\_check\_grace\_period\_seconds | Seconds to ignore failing load balancer health checks on newly instantiated tasks to prevent premature shutdown, up to 2147483647. Only valid for services configured to use load balancers. | `number` | `null` | no |
| iam\_daemon\_role | IAM Role for ECS Agent and Docker Daemon to use (ECR, etc.). Required if specifying `repositoryCredentials` in container configuration. | `string` | `null` | no |
| iam\_lb\_role | IAM Role ARN to use to attach service to Load Balancer. This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the awsvpc network mode. If using awsvpc network mode, do not specify this role. If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. | `string` | `null` | no |
| iam\_task\_role | IAM Role for task to use to access AWS services (dynamo, s3, etc.) | `string` | `null` | no |
| ignore\_desired\_count\_changes | Ignores any changes to `desired_count` parameter after apply. Note updating this value will destroy the existing service and recreate it. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| launch\_type | The launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are `EC2` or `FARGATE`. | `string` | `null` | no |
| load\_balancers | List of map for load balancers configuration. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| name | The service name. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| network\_configuration | Map of a network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. [Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/ecs_service.html#network_configuration) | `any` | `null` | no |
| ordered\_placement\_strategy | List of map of service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence. Max 5. [Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/ecs_service.html#ordered_placement_strategy) | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |

| platform\_version | The platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for `launch_type` set to `FARGATE`. Defaults to `LATEST`. [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) | `string` | `null` | no |
| propagate\_tags | Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are `SERVICE` and `TASK_DEFINITION`. | `string` | `null` | no |
